# Code-Novice
Beginners in Code Repo
I have been taught how to code using visual basic 2012 on my first semester at tertiary then i learnt some languages as PHP 7.1, C#,AND CSS on my own, Coding is fantastic more especially when you have capability to code and make errors which you are able to identify and correct.

I have decided to make this changes because i wanted to learn more of what i didnt know before.
